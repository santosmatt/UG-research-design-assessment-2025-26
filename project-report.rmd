## Task 1: Reproducing and improving figures

### Figure 3
```{r figure-3}
# Write your code for reproducing, and then improving Figure 3. Present both figures together. Under the figures, explain how you've improved Figure 3 and why you consider this an improvement.
```


### Figure 4
```{r figure-4}
# Write your code for reproducing, and then improving Figure 4. Present both figures together. Under the figures, explain how you've improved Figure 4 and why you consider this an improvement.
```


### Figure 5
```{r figure-5}
# Write your code for reproducing, and then improving Figure 5. Present both figures together. Under the figures, explain how you've improved Figure 5 and why you consider this an improvement.
```


## Task 2: FAIR data principles

## Task 3: Reproducibility brief
